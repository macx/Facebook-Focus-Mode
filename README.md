# Facebook Focus Mode

[![Install with Stylus](https://img.shields.io/badge/install%20with-stylus-2AFEFE)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macx/Facebook-Focus-Mode/main/facebook-focus-mode.user.css)

Facebook enlarges icons, paddings and widths of elements on larger screens, which is theoretically good. Unfortunately, it also does it for secondary elements, what deflects. Until now! Welcome to Facebook Focus Mode for Desktop!

## Installation

1. Install the browser extension Stylus for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylus/) or Cascadea for [Safari](https://cascadea.app/) to apply this style.
2. Apply it here: [facebook-focus-mode.user.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macx/Facebook-Focus-Mode/main/facebook-focus-mode.user.css).

## How does this work?

With a so-called user styles, you can override the styles from the origin page within your browser. You are a single click away, to apply the Focus Mode to your Facebook.
