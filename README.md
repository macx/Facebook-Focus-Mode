# Facebook-Focus-Mode
Focus Mode for Facebook on Desktop websites. If you wonder that Facebook on mobile is compact but not on Desktop, it's by design. The UI is tending to increase elements on larger screens, which is fine. But on Facebook, secondary Elements you are sparely using will increase as well. And this is distracting. Luckally, I could change this with this design.
